    <h3 class="major section-header noselect">Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
    In order to ensure a standard of quality of Issues, please aim to achieve the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
            <b>Refrain from <em>bias</em>.</b> <br>
            While issues can bring up a lot of different opinions, the point here is to simply <b>define the issue</b> without being biased towards
            one response or another. If bias is detected the issue will be at risk of deletion and likely be downvoted.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
            <b>Keep the Introduction <em>succinct</em>.</b><br>
            Someone should be able to get the gist of what the issue is about without reading the full and intricate details just yet.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
            <b>Articulate and support facts.</b><br> 
            Write comprehensibly. Support any/all factual claims with evidence and/or credible references. Imagine the body (<em>Extended Description</em>) as a research paper or Wikipedia article.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
